                <li><p style="font-weight:700;">Problem: </p><p> To tackle the problems faced by Street Vendors. Street vendors are often persecuted, live in uncertainty, and work in poor conditions with little access to infrastructure. In a city like Delhi, where 2.5% of the population consists of street vendors, they find it difficult to survive as it is easy to find hostels and fancy restaurants but not the street vendors.</p></li>
                <br>
                <li><p>Today, modern street vending plays a vital role in
                  the urban economy, as a source of jobs, revenue
                  and ‘value added’ to the economy. Street vending
                  provides a flexible link in economic supply chains,
                  gives vitality to urban streets, and provides
                  affordable goods for many urban residents. Yet
                  street vending exacerbates congestion at busy
                  sites (eg: city centres where competition for space
                  is acute) and vendors lack the facilities for ‘decent
                  work’. It is estimated that about 4 to 5 Lakh street vendors and hawkers are operating in Delhi today and are an integral part of the functioning of Delhi. In order to recognize the street vendors and formalize their operations we have created a site which will not only help the vendors but also the buyers. Markets in different Zones and create an MIS database for future interventions for regularization of street vending in Delhi. Street vendors form considerable part of Informal sector economy.</p></li>

                <br>
                <li><p style="font-weight:700;">Solution:</p><p>These days everyone has a basic smartphone so our hack is that we could build a platform where the street vendors can register as a seller and using their mobile the location of them will be directly updated on a map such that the buyers can access the location. along with location it will also show what service they are providing and their mobile number so customer can directly contact them. and the vendors can choose where to move so that there is more potential customer. </p></li>
                <br>
                <li><p>We will be creating a website with register option for seller as well as customer so seller. On the map the seller can update their location on daily basis so customers can find them and the customers can mark on map where they want the service or items so vendors can see where the demand is high and move to that location.</p></li>
                <br>

                <br>
                <li><p style="font-weight:700;">Outcomes:</p><p>with our application, it will be easy for the seller to find potential customers and find a place where there is less competition as well as it will a convenience for the user them. Thus, it will help them increase their sales.</p></li>
